This is a Minecraft plugin for Spigot/Paper servers that allows players to set their own status, which is displayed in the tab list and above their heads in-game.
## Features

- Set your own status with `/status <status>`
- Remove your status with `/status remove`
- Set status with formatting codes (for example to color them) with `/status &3<status> (/status help colorcodes)`
- Set other players' statuses with `/status <player> <status>` (requires `StatusPlugin.admin.setStatus` permission)
- Remove other players' statuses with `/status remove <player>` (requires `StatusPlugin.admin.setStatus` permission)
- Reload all statuses from file with `/status reload` (requires `StatusPlugin.admin.reload` permission) (Can be executed by console)
- View a list of all available color codes with `/status help colors`
- View info about the plugin with `/status info`
- Set a maximum length for statuses with `/status setmaxlength <length>` (requires StatusPlugin.admin.setMaxlength permission)
- Reset the maximum length of statuses to default (`15`) with `/status resetmaxlength` (requires StatusPlugin.admin.resetMaxlength permission)
  (Color codes in statuses are not counted towards the character limit)
- The status of every player is saved to a file, so they will keep their status when they rejoin the server.
- The Plugin supports `PlaceholderAPI v2.11.5`
  - The Plugin reloads statuses every 600 Game Ticks (30seconds) so the Placeholders can update themselves.
  - The Plugin got Placeholders:
    - `%tubsstatusplugin_status_playername%` (playname should be changed out for the real Playername, Duuuh.)
    - `%tubsstatusplugin_status%`
- The Plugin Supports `LuckPerms v5.4`
  - The Plugin supports LuckPerms prefix and suffix.
    - `%LP_prefix&%`
    - `%LP_suffix%`
- Groupmode
  - turn on Group Mode in the Config and preconfigure set Groups for Players
  - A Player will not be able to set a fully custom status but he can use one of the preconfigured Groups.
